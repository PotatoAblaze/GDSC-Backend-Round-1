# GDSC-Backend-Round-1
This is the repository for my submission for the GDSC backend round 1 recruitments.

NOTE:
1. File to be run is QuizManager.py
2. I have tried my best to make variable and method names very readable and understandable. Please let me know if the code is unreadable.
3. Question.py contains a basic class which acts as wrapper for a question
4. QuestionsList.py contains the dictionary given for the task
